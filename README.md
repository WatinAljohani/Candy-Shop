# CandyShopProject
We've developed a Java-based database system for Candy Shop, streamlining operations and enhancing efficiency. 
Employees can manage products seamlessly, from addition to deletion and updates. The system assists cashiers in handling orders,
aids drivers in timely deliveries, and empowers managers with real-time branch oversight. Customers enjoy a user-friendly interface for browsing the menu, 
creating personalized orders, and choosing delivery preferences with order tracking.
